# IMDb Movie List

This project is a C# console application designed to manage and display a list of movies based on user input. It allows users to add movies with IMDb ratings, and then provides options to filter and display these movies based on certain criteria.

## Features

- **Add Movies:** Users can enter the names and IMDb ratings of movies.
- **Display All Movies:** Shows a complete list of all movies added.
- **Filter by Rating:** Displays movies with IMDb ratings between 4 and 9.
- **Filter by Name:** Displays movies whose names start with the letter 'A'.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Movies:**
   - Users are prompted to enter the name and IMDb rating of each movie.
   - The application continues to prompt for additional movies until the user decides to stop.

2. **Displaying Movies:**
   - Once movie entry is complete, the application displays all movies in the list.
   - It then filters and displays movies based on the specified IMDb rating range (4 to 9).
   - Lastly, it filters and displays movies that start with the letter 'A'.
